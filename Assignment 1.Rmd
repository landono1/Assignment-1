We have data about `r nrow(gun_deaths)` individuals killed by guns. Only 
`r nrow(gun_deaths) - nrow(youth)` are older than 65. The distribution of the remainder is shown below: 

``` {r, echo = FALSE}

```{r youth-dist, echo = FALSE}
#the distribution of the age variable from the youth dataset
library (ggplot2)
youth %>% 
  ggplot(aes(age)) + 
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 1)

```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
#the distribution of youth by race.

youth %>%
  ggplot(aes(fct_infreq(race) %>% fct_rev()))  +
